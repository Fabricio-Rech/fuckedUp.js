# fuckedUp.js

## just proving how fucked up javascript potentially can be by using only ({[/>+!-=\]}) to code

### for the banana code and the calculations/string problems just open terminal and run
> open terminal and run
>>```node bananaCode.js```

### and for the coding with only ({[/>+!-=\]}) you have 2 options 
* >run the debugger and paste this in its terminal
>>```fromString("Z")``` 
>>> and you'll get a capital z using it and to prove it actually is a capital z you can use an 
>>>>```eval(fromString("Z"))```
#### or
* >comment the debugger and uncomment the compile and console.log
>>then in your terminal run
>>>```node index.js > output.js```
>>>>in output.js you'll have the console.log function using only ({[/>+!-=\]})
>>>>>so just run
>>>>>>```node output.js``` 
>>>>>>>and it will console.log("Hello World!")
